#
# Key Improvements:

# Modularized Code with Functions:
#   The script is organized into separate functions (display_options and execute_option) for displaying options and executing actions based on user input. This makes the code more modular and easier to understand.

# Improved Variable Naming:
#   Renamed option to a more descriptive variable name within the execute_option function.

# Using case Statement:
#   Replaced multiple if-elif statements with a case statement in the execute_option function. This makes the script cleaner and more readable.

# Input Validation:
#   Added input validation to ensure that the user enters a valid option (a number between 1 and 4).

# Consistent Environment Variable Usage:
#   The PY_ENV environment variable is set consistently based on the selected option, reducing redundancy and improving readability.

# Clear Error Handling:
#   Added a message to handle invalid input gracefully, prompting the user to enter a valid option.
